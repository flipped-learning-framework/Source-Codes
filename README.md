# Source Codes

We provide the source codes of the unfolded RNN model for predicting the learning curve of students. The settings of the unfolded RNN model are given below:

1. Hidden unit: 32.
2. Epoch: 100.
3. Batch size: 1.
4: Optimizer: stochastic gradient descent.
5. Activation function: ReLU.
