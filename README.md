# Source Codes

We provide the source code of the unfolded RNN model for predicting the learning curve of students. The settings of the unfolded RNN model are given below:

1. Hidden unit: 32.
2. Epoch: 100.
3. Batch size: 1.
4. Optimizer: stochastic gradient descent.
5. Activation function: ReLU.

The data was divided into three groups: training data (70%), validation data (15%), and test data (15%).
